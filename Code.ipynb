It originates from a continuing cardiovascular study conducted on individuals residing in Framingham, Massachusetts. The primary objective of this study is to classify and forecast whether a patient is at risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) within the next 10 years. The dataset comprises over 4,000 records and encompasses 15 attributes that contain information about the patients."
