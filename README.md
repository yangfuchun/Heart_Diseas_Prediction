# Heart_Diseas_Prediction

### Overview
Originally conceived as a junior year class project, this project began with basic machine learning techniques, manually combining factors to create binomial logistic models and assess their accuracy. However, as I self-taught more advanced machine learning algorithms and deepened my understanding of exploratory data analysis (EDA), I made significant improvements. The revamped project included enhanced EDA, compelling visualizations, improved feature importance evaluation methods, incorporation of upsampling techniques to address imbalanced datasets, etc. These changes aimed to produce more robust and insightful results. The project's primary goal was to predict the 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), recognizing the shift in health concerns in the United States from infectious diseases to chronic illnesses. We leveraged critical medical parameters such as age, total cholesterol levels, and heart rate, drawn from a public database with over 6000 records.
